### Contributing

We highly encourage contributions from the community! If you're passionate about fixing bugs or enhancing existing features, here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your personal copy of the Tracka repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a Branch:**  Switch to a new dedicated branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b improve-feature`).
3. **Implement Changes:** Edit the relevant files to incorporate your contribution.
4. **Add and Commit:** Stage your changes using `git add` and commit them with a clear and concise message (`git commit -am 'Improve feature'`).
5. **Push to Branch:** Push your committed changes to your forked branch (`git push origin improve-feature`).
6. **Pull Request:** Create a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the main Tracka repository. This allows us to review your contributions before merging them into the official codebase.

**Merging to Production:**

Following a successful review and approval of your Pull Request on the `main` branch, you can create a separate Pull Request from a new branch (e.g., `improve-feature`) to the `next` branch to deploy the changes to the production application.
